#Contributing to Social Media HTMX
##(Still don't have an offical name)

As an open source project, anyone can contribute.

An example of a contribution:
  *Bug fixes
  *Performance improvements
  *New Features

This is not a huge project so contributing isn't to complicated, for small bug fixes simply open an issue, and for new features or performance improvements open a pull request.
